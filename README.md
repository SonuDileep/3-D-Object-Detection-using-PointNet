## PointNet: *Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation*
### Introduction
This is a work by Charles R. Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, Leonidas J. Guibas from Stanford University.You can find the link to their paper here[https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593]. Their original work is done using tensorflow1.x and few other packages which are deprecated in newer version. So, I implemented their model using tensorflow 2.0 and python 3.7. Shown below is an example of 3D point cloud objects in ModelNet40 Dataset.
