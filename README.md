## PointNet: *Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation*
### Introduction
This is a work by Charles R. Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, Leonidas J. Guibas from Stanford University.You can find the link to their paper here[https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593]. Their original work is done using tensorflow1.x and few other packages which are deprecated in newer version. I implemented the model using tensorflow 2.0 .
